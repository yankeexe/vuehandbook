## What is a ComputedÂ Property

In Vue.js you can output any data value using parentheses:

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ count }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This property can host some small computations, for example

```html
<template>
  {{ count * 10 }}
</template>
```

but you're limited to a single JavaScript _expression_.

In addition to this technical limitation, you also need to consider that templates should only be concerned with displaying data to the user, not perform logic computations.

To do something more than a single expression, and to have more declarative templates, then you use a **computed property**.

Computed properties are defined in the `computed` property of the Vue component:

```html
<script>
export default {
  computed: {

  }
}
</script>
```

## An example of a computed property

Here's an example code that uses a computed property `count` to calculate the output. Notice:

1.  I didn't have to call `{{ count() }}`. Vue.js automatically invokes the function
2.  I used a regular function (not an arrow function) to define the `count` computed property because I need to be able to access the component instance through `this`.

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ count }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [1, 2, 3]
    }
  },
  computed: {
    count: function() {
      return 'The count is ' + this.items.length * 10
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Computed properties vs methods

If you already know about Vue methods, you may wonder what's the difference.

First, methods must be called, not just referenced, so you'd need to do:

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ count() }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [1, 2, 3]
    }
  },
  methods: {
    count: function() {
      return 'The count is ' + this.items.length * 10
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

But the main difference is that **computed properties are cached**.

The result of the `count` computed property is internally cached until the `items` data property changes.

Important: computed properties are **only updated when a reactive source updates**. Regular JavaScript methods are not reactive, so a common example is to use `Date.now()`:

```html
<template>
  <p>{{ now }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    now: function () {
      return Date.now()
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

It will render once, and then it will not be updated even when the component re-renders. Just on a page refresh, when the Vue component is destroyed and reinitialized.

In this case, a method is better suited for your needs.
